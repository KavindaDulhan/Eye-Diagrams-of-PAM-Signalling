# Eye-Diagrams-of-PAM-Signalling
Eye diagrams are used for visual analysis of the severity of inter symbol interference (ISI), accuracy of sampling timing extraction and noise immunity. In this project, eye diagrams are used to analyze the robustness of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and 4-PAM (pulse amplitude modulation) digital communication systems. In task 1, a random bit sequence is generated and those bits are mapped to BPSK symbols. Impulse train of BPSK symbols was convoluted with a pulse shaping filter. Three pulses were used as the impulse response of the pulse shaping filter. They were sinc pulse, raised-cosine pulse with α = 0:5 and raised-cosine pulse with α = 1 where α is the roll-off factor. After the task 1, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is added to the transmit signals with specified bit energy to noise ratio. Finally, in task 3, 4-PAM system is used. Then the eye diagrams are generated for the received signals with the presence of AWGN. Same pulse shaping filters as in task 1 are used.
